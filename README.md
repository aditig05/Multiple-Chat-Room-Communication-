# Multiple-Chat-Room-Communication-
# Chat Application

## Overview

This is a simple chat application developed in Java that allows multiple users to connect, chat, and optionally send files over a network. The application consists of both a server and client component.

## Features

- **Multiple Chat Rooms:** Users can join and participate in multiple chat rooms simultaneously.
- **Text Chat:** Users can exchange text messages in real-time.
- **File Transfer (Optional):** Users can send and receive files to/from other users.
- **User Interface:** Includes a basic text-based user interface for easy interaction.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
- An IDE or Java compiler for building the application.
- Knowledge of your network configuration (IP addresses and ports) if running the server on a remote machine.

## Usage

### Server

1. Open the project in your Java IDE.
2. Compile and run the `ChatServer` class to start the server.
3. Make note of the server's IP address and port for clients to connect.

### Client

1. Compile and run the `ChatClient` class.
2. Enter the server's IP address and port when prompted.
3. Choose a unique username.
4. Start chatting with other connected clients.

### File Transfer (Optional)

To enable file transfer functionality, you can add specific commands for sending and receiving files and implement the logic for transferring files over TCP or UDP sockets.

## Testing

1. Start the server and multiple client instances as described above.
2. Connect the clients to the server using the provided IP address and port.
3. Test text chat by sending messages between clients.
4. If you implemented file transfer functionality, test file sending and receiving.

## Error Handling and Security (Optional)

Implement error handling and security measures as described in the project's code and documentation. Ensure that the application handles exceptions gracefully and includes necessary security features such as data validation, authentication, and encryption.
